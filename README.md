# Express.js JSON Parsing Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with JSON request bodies in Express.js applications.

## Bug Description
The provided Express.js application fails to properly parse the JSON data sent in a POST request.  The `req.body` remains empty, despite the `express.json()` middleware being included. This usually indicates a misconfiguration or a misunderstanding of how the middleware functions. 

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring the `express.json()` middleware is properly positioned in the application's middleware stack before any route handlers that expect JSON data.  Additional checks ensure that the incoming request content type is correctly set to `application/json`.
